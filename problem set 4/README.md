# SI 579 Vanilla app

## To Run the App
The usual npm commands in the project root:
- `npm install` (which should only need to be done once, after that everything is installed )
- `npm start` will start the server so you can access the site via browser

## Files to be aware of
There are several files you don't need to be concerned with.
These are the ones you _should_ be
- `/index.html` is the html served when you start the app
- `/js` is the directory with the JavaScript files loaded by index.html
- `/css` is the directory with the CSS files loaded by index.html
